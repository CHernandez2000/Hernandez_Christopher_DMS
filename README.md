This DMS (Database Management System) program, that I have created is about managing data about a personal hobby of mine that I enjoy being building models and the models being referred to as Gunpla (Gundam Plastic Model), which the models are based on giant robot mechs from a Japanese franchise that dates back to 1979 called Mobile Suit Gundam. The purpose of this DMS program is for the program to contain data about Gunpla based by the name of the mobile suit (mechs piloted by people) for the Gunpla (Examples being RX-78-2 Gundam, Zaku II, Guncannon, Gouf, Aerial Gundam, Barbatos Gundam, Exia Gundam, Wing Gundam, God Gundam, Dom, etc.), build grades of the Gunpla models (Examples being HG (High Grade), MG (Master Grade), RG (Real Grade), PG (Perfect Grade), etc.), retail price, and availability status where all that data info will be stored on the program. The functionality of the program involves user input by adding Gunpla by first typing in the mobile suit name of the Gunpla and from there they have to input the build grade, price, and availability status being true or false. Users can also input the removal of the Gunpla by mobile suit name and the specific build grade. Users can also update the retail price and availability status of the Gunpla and once the program is done having data being inputted, the data can be viewed when running the program.
